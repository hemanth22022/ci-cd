Sure. My name is Hemanth. I have around 9 years of experience in DevOps engineering, focusing on automation, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and configuration management across AWS and Azure environments.
At Macy's, I was responsible for managing AWS infrastructure provisioning EC2, VPC, ELB, Route 53, and setting up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins integrated with Maven, SonarQube, JFrog Artifactory, and Ansible. I also worked with ECS, ECR, and automated deployments using Ansible and Terraform.
=======
At Nike, I focused on Azure DevOps. I deployed applications into AKS using Helm, implemented Terraform and Azure Bicep for IaC, integrated security using Azure Security Center and Sentinel, and managed CI/CD pipelines using Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions.
